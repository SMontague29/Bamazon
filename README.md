# Bamazon

This is the amazing Bamazon app! (Sorry Amazon...)

This app showcases proper use of MySQL to provide the user with a fake storefront in their console. Each page of JavaScript corresponds to a separate function of the app. Customers can purchase items they want, while managers and supervisors gain additional capability in stock manipulation.
